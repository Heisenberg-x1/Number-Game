# Number-Game
## A Simple Javascript Game


### Usage
To play the game, simply open the index.html file in your web browser. You will see a form where you can enter your guess for the random number. After you submit your guess, the game will tell you if your guess was too high, too low, or correct. If you guess the correct number, you will be given the option to play again.

### Development
If you want to modify the game or contribute to its development, you can clone the GitHub repository and make changes to the code. The game is built using vanilla JavaScript and does not require any additional libraries or frameworks.
